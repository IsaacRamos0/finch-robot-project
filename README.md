# Final Project: Finch Robot Challenges

## Essential Question
How can we apply object-oriented programming principles and Java concepts to create interactive, autonomous robot behaviors that solve real-world challenges?

## Project Overview
In this project-based learning experience, you will program a Finch 2.0 robot to perform one of three challenges:
1. Choreograph a dance routine (with movement, lights, and sound)
2. Create an artistic drawing using the robot's movements
3. Navigate a maze autonomously

Your program must demonstrate your understanding of Java programming concepts from APCSA and object-oriented design principles while creating an engaging robot behavior.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply Java programming concepts in a physical computing context
- Implement object-oriented design principles
- Develop problem-solving skills through algorithm development
- Create well-documented and maintainable code
- Practice technical communication through presentations and documentation

## Description of design choices
- When our code runs, the bird does the waltz. To be specific, our bird "walks" forwards, then backwards, then forwards and backwars again, then turns. This shows whoever is running the program how to do a basic step of waltz! If you've ever wanted to learn how to do this dance, our bird will help you. It shows you the basic moves of how to waltz. Our bird also beeps a tune before turning, helping you learn how to learn music cues. In dancing, specific tunes or parts of the song that goes with your dance gives you a cue of when to do a certain step. Our bird helps you with that. It also has cool colors! This makes our bird look cute. 

## Challenges faced and solutions
- A challenge we faced was starting our project. We didn't know where to start and how to incorporate methods. We knew we wanted to make our bird dance, but just overall didn't know where to start. We solved this problem by speaking up that we needed help. As soon as we recieved help on where to start, our creativity blew up. We started experimenting with the different things we could do with our bird like make the tail and beak light up and play sounds, and eventually we got to somewhere that we are really proud of. 

## Future enhancements
- If we were given more time on this project, we would have improved on the sounds and the tail colors. We only implemented the tail colors on the last day, and we were having trouble making it how we wanted it to be. We wanted it to be like a count down of the steps. After a step, 1/4 lights would turn off, telling you that there are 3 steps left to learn in the dance. Also, we would've improved the sound/beeps. Instead of just little beeps before it moves forwards, we would find a song to play instead. Waltz songs are complicated so that is why we would need more time in order to implement this into our project.
